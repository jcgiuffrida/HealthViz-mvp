# Social Determinants of Health in Chicago

### What is this?
This interactive scatterplot, produced through the Epidemiology and Public Health Informatics Unit at the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH), allows users to plot various social determinants, like economic, educational, housing, and demographic factors, against indicators of health like obesity and mortality in Chicago's 77 community areas. A good way to get started is to click on “Examples” and go through those links. 

You can put any variables on the `X` and `Y` axes to look at their relationship. The size of the bubbles indicates a third variable, which you can change by clicking `size`. Mouse over the bubbles for more information and to identify which community area a bubble represents. You can also see summary statistics of the variables selected to the right. 

### How was this built?
This is a visualization in d3.js visualization based on <http://bl.ocks.org/msbarry/9911363>. It is built entirely with open-source technologies, and uses the MIT License, so the entire visualization is free to reuse or modify with attribution. 

### Get involved
