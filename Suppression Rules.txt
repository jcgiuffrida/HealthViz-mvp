Counts are suppressed if:
Cancer:
* There were at least 1, but less than 10, occurrences in the area over the time period
* The relevant population within the area was less than 20 over the time period
	* In such a case, even a value of SUPPRESSED would otherwise give away meaningful information, as it's probably 1
Hospitalizations:
* There were at least 1, but less than 5, occurrences in the area over the time period
* The relevant population within the area was less than 20 over the time period
	* In such a case, even a value of SUPPRESSED would otherwise give away meaningful information, as it's probably 1
